## 1. Problem Statement, Motivation & Objectives

Over 285 million people worldwide live with visual impairments, making routine tasks like reading medication labels extremely hazardous. Medication errors — wrong drug, wrong dose, wrong timing — account for thousands of preventable hospitalisations annually, and the risk is dramatically higher for visually impaired patients who rely on caregivers or guesswork. Existing solutions such as smartphone OCR apps require good lighting, steady hands, stable internet, and significant technical literacy, creating an accessibility gap that a dedicated edge device can close.

Medi-Dock addresses this gap with a stationary "intelligent dock" — a device the user simply places a blister pack in front of. All processing happens on-device on a Raspberry Pi 5: no cloud, no data privacy concerns, and no latency from a network round-trip. The use of Edge AI is therefore central to the solution — it enables real-time inference under 100 ms per frame, full offline operation, and the ability to deploy in homes, care facilities, or rural clinics without internet infrastructure.

**Key Objectives:**
- Train a lightweight TinyStudent CNN via Knowledge Distillation (ResNet-18 teacher → ~0.18M-parameter student) capable of running on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU.
- Implement an on-device OCR pipeline using EasyOCR with CLAHE preprocessing to extract medication names from blister pack labels.
- Deploy a sentence-transformer embedding matcher to robustly identify medicine names even from noisy OCR output.
- Apply post-training magnitude pruning and INT8 dynamic quantisation to reduce model size and inference latency.
- Deliver an audio feedback system via DFPlayer Mini to communicate results to visually impaired users without any screen dependency.

## 2. Proposed Solution (Overview)

Medi-Dock is a two-stage edge-AI pipeline running entirely on a Raspberry Pi 5:

**Stage 1 — Visual Classification (Notebook 1):** A TinyStudent CNN classifies blister pack images into three categories: *Nimesulide*, *Ofloxacin + Ornidazole*, or *Other/Unknown*. This model is trained offline on Kaggle using Knowledge Distillation from a ResNet-18 teacher, then exported to ONNX and quantised to INT8.

**Stage 2 — OCR + Semantic Matching (Notebook 2):** The Raspberry Pi camera captures a 1920×1080 frame. EasyOCR with CLAHE contrast enhancement and 2× upscaling extracts text from the label. A sentence-transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) encodes the OCR output and computes cosine similarity against a pre-embedded medicine database to find the best match. A local dosage rules engine then cross-references the detected medicine with patient vitals (BMI, blood pressure, SpO2, blood sugar) to flag contraindications and suggest a dosage. Results are announced via DFPlayer Mini audio output.

**Overall Pipeline:**

```
Camera (Picamera2, 1920×1080)
  → CLAHE Preprocessing + 2× Upscaling
  → EasyOCR (text detection + recognition)
  → Sentence-Transformer Embedding
  → Cosine Similarity vs Medicine Database
  → Dosage Rules Engine (vitals cross-check)
  → Audio Output (DFPlayer Mini + Speaker)
       +
  → TinyStudent ONNX Model (visual classification fallback/confirmation)
```

## 4. Data Collection & Dataset Preparation

### Data Sources

Three public Kaggle datasets were combined with a custom synthetic dataset:

1. [Medicine Tablet Pack Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitesh31mishra/medicine-tablet-pack-image-dataset) — real blister pack photos under varied lighting.
2. [Mobile Captured Pharmaceutical Medication Packages](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mobile-captured-pharmaceutical-medication-packages) — angled and partially occluded captures.
3. [Drug Name Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/the-drug-name-detection-dataset) — focused on label region detection.

### Synthetic Data Generation

Because real-world data for the specific target medicines (Nimesulide and Ofloxacin+Ornidazole) was limited, a programmatic synthetic blister-pack generator was built using OpenCV. The generator renders realistic blister strip images including a label strip with drug name, dosage, batch, and expiry text, plus blister cell geometry, with random rotation (±8°) applied per sample.

### Dataset Distribution

| Class | Real Images | Synthetic Images | Total |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Nimesulide (0) | ~variable | 2,000 | ~2,000+ |
| Ofloxacin + Ornidazole (1) | ~variable | 1,500 | ~1,500+ |
| Other / Unknown (2) | ~variable | 800 | ~800+ |

### Preprocessing

- **ROI Extraction:** Otsu thresholding + morphological dilation to locate the text strip region; crop ±25px padding; resize to 224×224.
- **Augmentation Pipeline (Albumentations):** Random crop (256→224), horizontal flip, rotation (±15°), brightness/contrast jitter (±35%), Gaussian noise, motion blur, ImageNet normalisation.
- **Train / Val Split:** 85% / 15%.

## 5. Model Design, Training & Evaluation

### Architecture

**Teacher — ResNet-18** (PyTorch Hub, ImageNet pre-trained, ~11M parameters). Final FC layer replaced with a 3-class head.

**Student — TinyStudent CNN** (~0.18M parameters, designed for Raspberry Pi 5 CPU inference):

```
Input (3×224×224)
 → Conv2d(3→16, k=3, s=2) + BN + ReLU + MaxPool  → 56×56
 → Conv2d(16→32, k=3) + BN + ReLU + MaxPool       → 28×28
 → Conv2d(32→64, k=3) + BN + ReLU + MaxPool       → 14×14
 → Conv2d(64→128, k=3) + BN + ReLU + AdaptiveAvgPool(1×1)
 → Linear(128 → 3)
```

### Training — Knowledge Distillation

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Epochs | 25 |
| Optimiser | AdamW (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4) |
| Scheduler | CosineAnnealingLR (T_max=25) |
| Batch Size | 48 |
| KD Temperature (T) | 4.0 |
| KD Alpha (α) | 0.4 (hard label weight) |
| Loss | α × CrossEntropy + (1-α) × KL-Divergence × T² |

The teacher is frozen during training. The student learns from both hard labels and the teacher's soft probability distribution, enabling it to match the teacher's generalisation with 60× fewer parameters.

### Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Top-1 Accuracy | Primary metric — tracked per epoch on validation set |
| Best Validation Accuracy | Saved checkpoint used for export |

Validation accuracy and loss were tracked per epoch; the best checkpoint was saved and used for export.

## 6. Model Compression & Efficiency Metrics

### Techniques Applied

**1. Magnitude-based Unstructured Pruning (post-training)**
All weight tensors with `|w| ≤ 0.025` are zeroed out. Applied after KD training to remove redundant weights without retraining.

**2. Dynamic INT8 Quantisation (ONNX Runtime)**
`quantize_dynamic()` from `onnxruntime.quantization` converts weight tensors to INT8. This halves model storage and reduces memory bandwidth during inference.

**3. TFLite Conversion with Default Optimisations**
The quantised ONNX model is converted to TensorFlow SavedModel via `onnx-tf`, then to TFLite with `tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT`.

### Efficiency Results

| Model Format | Size | Inference (CPU, ~) |
|---|---|---|
| Full ONNX (FP32) | ~0.73 MB | ~25–40 ms/frame |
| INT8 Quantised ONNX | ~0.19 MB | ~12–20 ms/frame |
| TFLite (quantised) | ~0.20 MB | ~15–22 ms/frame |

> *Note: Inference benchmarks measured via `onnxruntime` on CPU with 200 warm-up runs. On-device RPi 5 timings will be slightly higher (~30–60 ms) due to ARM CPU differences.*

**Trade-offs:** Pruning at threshold=0.025 removes a portion of near-zero weights with negligible accuracy loss on the validation set. INT8 quantisation introduces minor quantisation error but reduces model size by ~4× and improves CPU cache utilisation.

## 7. Model Deployment & On-Device Performance

### Deployment Steps

1. Export `best_student.pth` → `mediscan_student.onnx` (opset 13, dynamic batch axis).
2. Apply dynamic INT8 quantisation → `mediscan_student_int8.onnx`.
3. Convert to TFLite → `mediscan_student.tflite`.
4. Copy `.onnx` model to Raspberry Pi 5 at `/home/rpi7/Desktop/mediscan_student.onnx`.
5. Install dependencies on RPi: `onnxruntime`, `easyocr`, `sentence-transformers`, `picamera2`, `opencv-python`.
6. Run `mediscan_pipeline.py` (Notebook 2, Cell 5) for full capture-to-output pipeline.

### On-Device Performance (Raspberry Pi 5)

| Stage | Estimated Latency |
|---|---|
| Camera capture (Picamera2, 1080p) | ~1 s (AWB settle) |
| CLAHE + denoising + 2× upscale | ~80–120 ms |
| EasyOCR inference (CPU, no GPU) | ~3–6 s |
| Sentence-transformer embedding | ~200–400 ms |
| ONNX model inference (classification) | ~30–60 ms |
| Total pipeline (end-to-end) | ~5–8 s |

<!-- > 📷 *[Add a screenshot of the terminal output showing the medicine detection + dosage report — save as `assets/terminal_output.png`]* -->

EasyOCR dominates latency. This is acceptable for a stationary dock use case where the user places the strip and waits for the audio announcement. Future work (Section 10) addresses this with a lighter OCR backend.

## 8. Conclusions & Limitations

Medi-Dock demonstrates that a fully offline, sub-10-second medication identification pipeline is achievable on a Raspberry Pi 5 costing under ₹5,000. The TinyStudent CNN trained via Knowledge Distillation achieves competitive classification accuracy at only ~0.18M parameters. Combined with EasyOCR and semantic embedding-based medicine matching, the system handles noisy, partially visible, and rotated labels with reasonable robustness.

**Limitations:**
- EasyOCR on CPU is the primary bottleneck (~3–6 s per frame); it requires bright, even lighting for reliable character recognition.
- The medicine database is currently limited to a small set of common Indian pharmaceuticals and must be manually expanded.
- The dosage recommendation module is for demonstration only and must not be used as actual clinical advice.
- The synthetic data generator produces idealistic blister strips; real-world label diversity (fonts, colours, foil reflections) is only partially covered.
- No hardware dose scheduling (e.g., reminder alarms) is currently implemented.

---

## 9. Future Work

- **Faster OCR backend:** Replace EasyOCR with a purpose-trained CRNN (Connectionist Recurrent Neural Network) quantised to TFLite to reduce OCR latency from ~5 s to under 500 ms.
- **Active camera alignment:** Add a servo-controlled camera arm so the system automatically centres and focuses on the label.
- **Expanded medicine database:** Integrate with the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) India drug database for comprehensive coverage.
- **BLE-connected companion app:** Allow caregivers to remotely view dose logs and configure reminders.
- **Multi-language support:** Add Hindi and regional Indian language OCR for rural deployments.
- **Structured pruning:** Replace unstructured magnitude pruning with channel pruning for actual FLOP reduction (not just zero weights) on ARM hardware.

| Running knowledge distillation on a large dataset | Training run on Kaggle GPU; student model exported to ONNX + INT8 quantised for RPi deployment |
| Audio output without BLE/TWS complexity | Used DFPlayer Mini + direct speaker connection, eliminating pairing latency and connection drop issues |
| ONNX opset compatibility | Fixed by using opset 13 with `do_constant_folding=True` and dynamic batch axis |
